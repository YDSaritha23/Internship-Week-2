# Internship-Week-2
Tasks:  ○ Perform descriptive statistics on numerical and categorical features. ○ Use visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn to create histograms, pair plots, and heatmaps. ○ Identify missing values, outliers, and imbalances.

Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis for Understanding Dataset Trends and Relationships
Objective:
This project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to uncover significant patterns, relationships, and distributions. The insights gained will guide subsequent data preprocessing, feature selection, and modeling processes.

Key Deliverables:
1.	Descriptive Statistics Report:
o	Summary of central tendencies (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, range) for numerical features.
o	Frequency distribution of categorical features to understand dominant categories and variability.
2.	Visual Analysis Report:
o	Histograms: Visual representation of feature distributions to identify skewness, spread, and potential outliers.
o	Pair Plots: Scatterplots between pairs of numerical features to detect trends and correlations.
o	Correlation Heatmap: Matrix visualization highlighting relationships between features and their potential impact on target variables.
3.	Insights and Recommendations:
o	Key patterns and anomalies identified in the data.
o	Actionable recommendations for handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

Detailed Steps:
1.	Understanding the Dataset:
o	Separation of numerical and categorical features for customized analysis.
o	Central tendency and dispersion analysis for numerical data.
o	Frequency analysis for categorical data to observe imbalances or dominance.
2.	Data Visualization:
o	Histograms provide a granular view of individual feature distributions.
o	Pair plots allow for visual correlation analysis between numerical features.
o	Heatmap highlights significant relationships for informed feature selection.
3.	Insights Extraction:
o	Detect features with high variability or skewness.
o	Identify highly correlated features for further analysis or removal of redundancy.
